2023-12-25,New Order,2020,https://boxd.it/5opIal,,Yes,"As a Mexican who grew up and lives in Mexico City, this could have been so much, but instead chose the easy way out; a provocative garbage that counts on shock value alone because it lacks any type of substance, that is too full of itself, and that does not care to talk about the underlying problems, nor create any type of meaningful connection with any character whatsoever.

What an ignorant and reductionist way to look at Mexicoâ€™s socioeconomic problems. If the movie is not even trying, why should I try?

This sounds more like a political campaign add gone bad, than an actual movie.

What a waste of time.",,2023-12-24
