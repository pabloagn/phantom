2023-12-11,You Won't Be Alone,2022,https://boxd.it/5iPbYF,5,,"Hands down the best horror film I’ve seen in a very long time. This one feels extremely real, close, and overall, it’s absolutely beautiful. So raw and human it’s painful.

Similar in tone to The Witch, Perfume: Story of a Murderer, etc. this movie is something else.",,2023-12-06
2023-12-11,The Outwaters,2022,https://boxd.it/5iPc0B,4,,"This one was obviously very polarizing. You can clearly see how people hated it or loved it. True, it’s made for a very specific audience, but I gotta say <b>The Outwaters</b> was one of the most disturbing experiences I’ve ever had with any film.

There is something primal that is inherently evil with this movie. This is the perfect Lovecraftian story.",,2023-12-02

2023-12-11,New Order,2020,https://boxd.it/5iPcbf,,,"As a Mexican who grew up and lives in Mexico City, this could have been so much, but instead chose the easy way out; a provocative garbage that counts on shock value alone because it lacks any type of substance, that is too full of itself, and that does not care to talk about the underlying problems, nor create any type of meaningful connection with any character whatsoever.

What an ignorant and reductionist way to look at Mexico’s socioeconomic problems. If the movie is not even trying, why should I try?

This sounds more like a political campaign add gone bad, than an actual movie.

What a waste of time.

Here Michel Franco, you can have 0 stars. Go learn something from Alfonso Cuarón.

Without context, this would've been still an excellent film but maybe difficult to put together, but the fact that this can be watched as the lost tape that explains Laura Palmer's behavior is simply breathtaking.

Highly recommended if you're a Twin Peaks lover. There are some scenes here you'll never forget.",,2022-05-15

2023-12-11,Andrei Rublev,1966,https://boxd.it/5iPcvT,5,,"I saw this film when exploring Tarkovsky's work (I saw 3 - 4 of his films during COVID lock-down), and all of them left me speechless, but there's something about Andrei Rublev that hit harder & deeper. I thought for a while since it was so unusual, and then I realized...

Andrei Rublev gave me the exact same feeling to that of reading The Brothers Karamazov. From that point I understood that Tarkovsky was a master to behold for the ages, not just as a director, but as a human being.

Andrei Rublev is a beautiful piece of art where faith is put to the test, where beliefs mutate & seem fragile, where greed becomes evident & violence corrupts the soul. Andrei Rublev is expansive, magnanimous, and manages to echo to places I never thought existed.

This film is a true masterpiece that will stay in my heart forever.

2023-12-11,Stalker,1979,https://boxd.it/5iPcxP,5,,"I remember reading House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski and immediately thinking I had read a haunted book. If there's such thing as a haunted film, this is it. But what does it mean for a piece of art to be haunted?

In the case of Stalker, I would say it's many things: the cinematography, the atmosphere, the selection of colors, the camera movements, the music & sound, the performances, the camera angles, the pace, and I think I'm missing a few, but the message here is that it's a collection of a lot of components very carefully put together.

But then, what does it mean for a piece of art to be haunted? Well, it haunts our mind, it makes it very difficult to forget, like it almost became a part of us, a real experience we lived. In fact, I think of Stalker as a mirror to one-self. A mirror so powerful it reflects our own spirituality while asking the question: What do we want in life? Do we even know?

But how does Stalker achieve this? I think there are two key components:
1. Because of its pacing and atmosphere, it provides a safe space for us to be able to get entirely lost and enter a meditative state. We become hypnotized, and every external stimuli suddenly disappears, just as when we meditate. The difference is that when meditating, we're often not stimulated visually and are most probably not following a story. Thus, Stalker takes the role of our own imagination, of the sequence of images being unraveled in front of us as we fall into a deep state of trance.
2. The ambiguity of many of the plot devices, and the plot itself, make us surrender to the fact that we might not ultimately know it all. The faster we accept this & let go, the faster the movie starts to sink in. The faster we stop thinking of Stalker as some mystery we must decipher, the faster we will truly know its meaning.

So, what are my thoughts, and why is Stalker one of my favorite art pieces of all time?

Stalker felt like a beautiful, nostalgic & horrific dream throughout the entire 162 minutes of runtime. And in the end, when I wake up, I know it was all a dream, but nonetheless I feel that something has changed inside me, forever, at a spiritual level. I know I saw my inner-self in some way. I know I may even have involuntarily meditated.

I don't really know how to describe this movie since it's so unconventional. I also don't know how Tarkovsky pulled this off, how he imagined such complex sequences in his head prior to putting them on screen, how he managed to make me feel with such intensity without having a clue of what I was feeling at the moment. This movie seems impossible, almost like an enchanted paradox to some extent. I literally wanted to cry when it ended, and I had no idea why. I now realize I had gone through one of the most intense therapy sessions I've experienced.

Stalker is the horror film you never knew it was a horror film, the film you never knew you desperately needed, the film that will slowly creep on you and haunt you for the rest of your life, the film that inspired so many other works it's now part of the collective unconscious. Such deep spirituality embedded in this masterpiece it's sometimes difficult to make sense of it, but the funny thing is, it sounds too familiar as well, since it's a mirror to one's soul.

I'm afraid we'll never get something remotely close to Tarkovsky. Such a unique & intriguing mind.

Recommendations:
- If possible, watch Stalker on a big screen with proper audio (noise cancelling headphones should work great), also, watch it uninterrupted, the same way as you would do a meditation session. Put yourself in a comfortable position and let go.
- Same as I did, you may actually come out a different person if you have the patience to withstand this 3-hour long masterpiece.",,2021-07-03
2023-12-11,Shame,1968,https://boxd.it/5iPczL,5,,"What a powerful depiction of cowardice, but is it really cowardice? Would you do the same?

Hollywood has always depicted the role of men as protectors, as the physically & emotionally strong, as the ones that should stand for what they love & care about, as the ones that should stop the aggressor and protect the assaulted. The strength in men has always been thought of as a given variable.

But what would happen if a horrible war burst out and suddenly you had a fully-fledged armed militia standing at your doorstep, threatening your wife & everything you love? Are you equipped with the tools required to face real-life monsters? What would you do? Would you become the protector, or the abused? Would you protect your wife over your own life? Would your human relations endure after the conflict is over?

Shame puts that to the test, and it does it better than any movie I've ever seen.

Bergman certainly knew a lot about the human experience. He was, after all, a genius.",,2021-07-03
2023-12-11,The Great Beauty,2013,https://boxd.it/5iPcAf,5,,"Hands down my favorite film up until now.

Since I read In Search of Lost Time, I'm always looking for Proustian-like art, where there's nostalgia mixed with a sense of absolute & almost immaculate beauty.

This film captures that like no other.

2023-12-11,Come and See,1985,https://boxd.it/5iPcAT,5,,"Before this film I think I somewhat ""knew"" what happened in war as depicted by the thousands of films, documentaries & books out there. Turns out I hadn't the slightest idea.

This for me is the single best anti-war film ever made, and one of the best films ever made, period. It's also the most disturbing film I've seen, and not because of the sheer visceral scenes, or the awful depiction of genocide, or the kids turning into old people in a matter of days, or the depiction of despair, or the slow decline to madness, or the perpetual sound of bombers buzzing in the sky, or the fact that soldiers were not soldiers anymore, they were animals.

No no, what makes this film powerful is the fact that it's real. You feel like you're there, with Flyora & Olga, watching them suffer the absolute worst hell imaginable, being complicit in some way. And the only thing you can do is keep watching, hoping that the next scene will offer some kind of  comfort, but it doesn't, it never does.

This is what makes a good anti-war movie. It's the one that traumatizes your senses and breaks your heart, as if you were there, watching. The one that will offer no comfort, no heroes, no victory, no nothing. The only thing left in war is suffering and death.

Come and see what a beautifully devastating piece of art this is.",,2021-07-03
2023-12-11,Belle de Jour,1967,https://boxd.it/5iPcC1,5,,"Luis Buñuel, the de-facto provocateur with a wit many people could only wish to have, always looking to confront his own audience. And who would fit Belle better than Catherine Deneuve? Absolutely no one. This was a match made to be.

I genuinely felt like I was watching something that I should not watch throughout the entire film, even though it's not ""evil enough"" in today's standards.

This film is what happens when one of the most beautiful & talented actresses ever known to mankind meets the master of provocation. A dangerous, explosive mixture that has influenced thousands of creative pieces.

2023-12-22,Anatomy of a Fall,2023,https://boxd.it/5mTe7D,4.5,,"This is a movie that:
- Has complete trust on the public: It never underestimates its audience.
- Does not rush on conclusions: It takes its time for the pieces to slowly & painfully fall into place.
- Has complete trust on its actors: This movie can be though of a discourse of people (you, me, everyone else) vs. Sandra Voyter.
- Gives the audience complete power: To become part of the jury in the most realistic way possible. We never see more than we should. We don't actually fully know the main characters, and never will.
- Is not looking to solve a murder mystery as the main plot point: Instead, it focuses on showing how complex the human nature can be.
- Is extremely ambiguous: There's no black nor white. There's simply a vast palette colors in between.
- Does not hurry to take sides: In fact, it never takes sides. Characters are not hated nor loved.

In short:
- This is a masterful movie that plays with the fact that we'll never know another person fully.

2023-12-22,mother!,2017,https://boxd.it/5mTegF,5,,"This review is based on my own interpretation of this film. When I read Aronofsky's explanation, I was not satisfied; in fact, I think I hated it; I found it too reductionist and too much of a cautionary tale; as if Greta Thunberg had a bad acid trip, got pissed off, and decided to make a movie about it. No thanks.

Instead, I think that this masterful film has the capacity to be interpreted in multiple ways, and that's what always matters when consuming art.

This is a movie that:
- Is anxiety inducing: I actually read a review about someone having a panic attack at the middle of the movie, and yes, I can absolutely relate. The entire movie feels like you took too much Adderall and know how bad you fucked up without being able to throw it up. It escalates and escalates to the point of absolute madness.
- Does feel like a bad acid trip, mixed with the worst nightmare you'll ever have: It's transgressive, confusing, weird, and many scenes will not make sense without Aronofsky's explanation, which I think even gives it an edge?
- Does not hold back: It's brutal & explicit to the point of being unbearable to watch in many instances.
- It's uncomfortable, extremely uncomfortable: Mainly for our main character, which literally and metaphorically gets consumed without her being able to take any kind of control over anything (her house, her husband, the people).

In short:
- This is a masterful movie that shows how love is an asset. Sometimes people give love, sometimes people need love, but sometimes people desperately need love and take it by force.

Up to the first quarter, the plot is similar to other revenge movies, where there is a gruesome act perpetrated by a sicko and a counterpart in grief who decides to take matters into his own hands. But then, things take a different turn, and boy it gets extreme to the point of making Taken and every other Hollywood revenge film look like an absolute child’s play.

Excellent at depicting realism in the countryside<b>. </b>The quiet life, the Shashliks, the Vodka, target-shooting in the fields, the old trucks, the passionate characters, all very reminiscent of some of the most memorable characters from classic Russian literature.

But the the countryside is also a place where local government is omnipotent and human rights are quietly dissolved to the point of reducing human beings to mere obstacles. The countryside that is also a beautiful place, where vast fields and lakes are covered by dense fog.

And Russia, a country where the church and the government are welded together, where the divine power of God is brought upon by people, and the fates of those succumbing under such weight is justifiable. Russia, a country that has not been able to escape its past.

And the best thing is, it watches like a piece of literary mastery; for those familiar with East of Eden, The Bell Jar, etc, this is extremely close in atmosphere & narrative form.

And it does not end there because The Gulag Archipelago is actually referenced (if I remember correctly, Dominick was reading it); all that suffering, all that tragedy and for what? What type of God would let this happen? Who is God? Well, as Dominick put it, God is in all of us. God is in the people. So much resemblance to Solzhenitsyn & even Dostoievsky.

Thanks Wally Lamb, Derek Cianfrance, Mark Ruffalo, Harold Budd, & Beach House for this mesmerizing experience. This was a gift to humanity.

However…I gotta be honest; the shock was not as dense since watching a similar film (<i>plot-twist wise</i>) just some days ago implanted a strong suggestion of what would happen, and also helped smooth the shock of the awful scene at the end, but it was still one of the best and saddest plot twists I’ve ever seen.

So, hmm, what is it? What do I smell here? Initially I smell a lot of politeness, Champagne & expensive wine, art exhibitions, signature cuisine, politically-correct talks, everything seems very nice until…what’s that smell…something reeking from below, waiting to blow-up, the shit accelerating, slowly, waiting to hit the fan, and when it hits, it hits hard, and splashes everyone on sight. And everyone shrieks in disgust, yelling that they never asked for this, that the shit is not theirs, too dirty, and that this mess should be cleaned asap. But it’s already too late, the damage is done, everyone has been splashed one way or another, everyone now carries a tiny bit of shit.

Ohh yeah, I know what I smell now! It’s Ruben Östlund! But on steroids, with a touch of Ducournau’s Raw as dressing, and with a distinct nihilistic slap in the face. 

Yes, that’s it. Scandinavian cinema has a very clinically-cold, raw, hilariously-dark & effective way of illustrating double standards. So much so that it can become disgusting & almost unbearable, but this is what makes it effective, what makes it hit so hard. The slap in the face the Östlund way.

2023-12-28,A Separation,2011,https://boxd.it/5qcAwl,4.5,,"I recently had the pleasure of collaborating with an Iranian coworker. She used to tell me stories of how beautiful & kind Iranian people were, and how her country had changed so much since Ayatollah took power in the late 70s, how Iran “was not what it used to be anymore”.

Around that same time I was actually watching <a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/tehran"" rel=""nofollow"">Tehran</a> (<i>the plot was ok but what really kept me going was the cultural context, the performances and the beautiful Farsi</i>).

During <i>A Separation</i>, I was once again transported to the Iranian culture, and was once again exposed to the language & the people. And boy how I missed it.

Anyhow, A Separation is the perfect example of how complex things can get with regards to interpersonal relations and human interaction. It shows that there’s hardly ever black & white, but a palette of thousands of shades in between. And also, that we don’t know what the person we just met might be going through.

There’s a strong discussion on pride and what it means to be responsible for a family; when does a decision start serving our own interests, and harms the interests of our loved ones? How can we balance our inner weaknesses in a way that we’re still faithful to our beliefs, but can protect the ones we love? Why is accepting that we were wrong so difficult sometimes? What differentiates a humble person from a proud person?

<i>A Separation</i> explores all of these questions and many more facets of what it means to be human, and it does so in a very realistic & raw way. It watches more as a documentary than a movie.

Excellent film.",,2023-12-27
2023-12-30,Mommy,2014,https://boxd.it/5rhp0n,5,,"<blockquote><i>Feet don't fail me now</i>
<i>Take me to the finish line</i>
<i>Oh, my heart it breaks every step that I take</i>
<i>But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine</i></blockquote>
Funny how we see Steve quickly losing control multiple times, yet that final scene made me loose control in less than 5 secs.

Wow, this film was…incredibly accurate.

I know a couple of people with fairly strong cases of ADHD accompanied by other conditions, and its depiction in Mommy is spot on.

The first acquaintance is a distant cousin whom I’ve only seen 3 - 4 times when we went on family vacation, and he had pretty a unmanageable case of ADHD along with other personality disorders <i>(his family never explicitly told us, but we knew it wasn’t just that)</i>.

I remember very clearly how he treated his mother and siblings, and how his mother, regardless of her already being an expert in managing his behavior, still struggled a lot when he lashed; it was really painful to see because you could physically notice the toll this had already had on his older brothers.

He was extremely harsh with how he talked to people, very stubborn, and also very sexually & emotionally impulsive. It was like the part of his brain in charge of moderating impulsive behavior & fine motor coordination had gone completely off. One minute he would be doing sand castles and the other he would get naked and start randomly insulting people walking in the beach. Being with him was like waiting for a thunderstorm without knowing when and how it would hit, nor when would it end.

On top of this, he also got hyper fixated with very specific things; he would not let go until he got what he wanted or something more interesting grabbed his attention.

We don’t keep in touch, but I sometimes hear about how his family has invested practically their entire life to looking after him and making sure he can live a somewhat normal life. Thank God they have financial means to sustain his needs; otherwise I could not imagine how much difficult it would be for them.

Unfortunately, I never got to know the other face of the coin; I never knew how he was like when he was loving, caring & empathetic with other people, something Mommy beautifully & brilliantly displays in multiple occasions.

I have a somewhat limited experience on interacting with people having severe behavior disorders, but I gotta say this movie is extremely accurate at portraying what I saw with my cousin; literally the smallest of the details is there, and it’s really chilling & difficult to see. I cannot imagine the impact this would have on someone more familiar with the condition.

So, final thoughts? For starters, that aspect ratio change is one of the most powerful & original editing techniques I’ve ever seen. Also, those last 30 mins are some of the most painful I’ve ever experienced in cinema. But that final scene…that final fucking scene is on fire; it’ll stay in my memory & will be cherished in my heart forever, as one of the most beautiful depictions of the human experience.

Because it feels so real; it has a documentary-like feeling that showcases not only how devastating heinous acts can be for the immediately-related, but also how incredibly obsessive certain people (the fanbase) can become when talking about brutal violence.

And even though the movie never shows explicit scenes, the visceral reactions of the involved / jury / family / judge are enough to provide some gut-wrenching moments, much more powerful than those much more explicit from other movies.

Just…heartbreaking stuff.

This is my first Cassavetes and I really enjoyed it; it’s funny how we sometimes complain about the lack of empathy for mental illness today, when back then things were as they were. So little understanding of how much a person could suffer.

It’s brilliant how Cassavetes clearly understood this, and portrayed it as perfect and sad as in this film. He understood that people thought of mental illness as something wrong that had a practical solution -> just get some rest and you’ll be fine, you’re most likely very tired, that’s all.

2024-02-13,The Curse,2023,https://boxd.it/5OPqZB,5,,"Jonathan Franzen meets Kafka meets Cassavetes?

The Curse is the ultimate portrait of the abrasive nature of us millennials and how we try to “change things” when no one asked us to do so. This necessity of colonizing, of getting there first, of reinventing the wheel over and over again because fuck it, it’s not to my liking? Who cares what other people think about it (Elon Musk and friends can take note here).

The Curse is also a show that depicts (very brutally) what happens when we humans try to constantly live in our own reality and things go haywire. It talks a lot about the perception we have about ourselves and other people, the biases we can have, and the awful consequences of losing track of ourselves and start living in our <i>whitneyverse</i>.

This is also a show where all 3 main characters are despicable, sad, pitiful and dangerously relatable, where 95% of the sequences are extremely uncomfortable, and where nothing is what it seems.

It's also (very interestingly) one of the most disturbing shows I've watched? The Curse genuinely made me feel sick in a way that's very difficult to describe. It has this very heavy emotional energy that almost drags you to the floor with it, and the characters feel it as well; they're conscious that they're living in a nightmare, and a very real one; hell, they don’t even understand what they’re getting into due to their loss of self-consciousness.

The performances are something out of this world; Nathan Fielder has got to be one of the most (if not the most) talented comedians I've had the pleasure to watch; thank God I still have his two other shows left to binge. Benny Safdie's direction and performance blew me away (this is my first approach to him), and Emma Stone is now one of my favorite contemporary actresses, pushing the limits of what can be done.

The soundtrack works as an integral part of the story, but never do we know which emotions should we be feeling or why; we simply feel (a lot) during The Curse. The sound works on an almost subconscious level; genius stuff.

Overall a brilliant show, although it can be a lot sometimes; I found myself peeking through my sweater multiple times.

As it was brilliantly put in <a href=""https://youtu.be/7pOAQKY7qvc?si=DDcaltZjNs9p6IDt"" rel=""nofollow"">this review</a>, I think The Curse is still too close to the bone and will not be fully appreciated or understood for at least some years. There are  still “too many Whitneys out there”.

10/10 without any reservation whatsoever. Just a perfect show.",,2024-02-12
2024-11-10,The Substance,2024,https://boxd.it/7LHked,1,,"The film starts with a powerful-enough kick, presenting a premise that is obviously very Dorian Grey-esque. The entire atmosphere is highly inspired off of Cronenbergs’ (both David & Brandon) works, gives strong hints of Italian Giallo pioneers such as Argento, and is even pulling bits & pieces from Ducournau’s Titane. Body horror is definitely there from the start, and keeps getting more intense as we progress throughout the story. Even the body transformation sequences are taken basically bit by bit from Possessor / Infinity Pool, but the quality is much more underwhelming here.

Unfortunately, everything starts falling apart around the half mark. The premise is stretched and stretched until there is not much “Substance” left; one can see the exact moment the writer runs out of ideas. The rhythm feels scattered, convoluted, out of focus, and overall absent of clear direction. I see the intent, it’s there, but the execution is extremely dire, specially during the last hour or so.

This feels like a mishmash of a bunch of master film makers, taking influences from left to right without being careful or elegant about it. The result is…an abomination. The director needs to gain expertise before compromising an unapologetic piece such as this one. <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/sick-of-myself/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sick of Myself</a> by Borgli managed an abysmally better job at everything with probably way less than half the budget.

Now onto Margaret Qualley. This is the second movie from her I’ve seen recently that leaves a very bad taste, as if she’s trying too hard, as if she’s really not that good of an actress and the only reason why she’s there is her physique and (maybe) her Mia Goth-like capacities of playing psychotic outbursts (and even then she seems to be trying too hard…Mia blows her out of the water any time). Ironically, this role almost fits her well. There’s something desperate about her, something underdeveloped. Maybe she just needs more time, but I won’t be watching any more of her soon. I’ve had enough for now.

I’ll be very frank; by the end I just fucking hated this movie to the guts, however the first 30 minutes hooked me enough to give it at least a star, plus some of the effects are good, and Demi Moore has some good bits as well.


If you’re wondering if you should watch this, watch some Cronenbergs first.

Throughout the entire movie you get the sense that something’s wrong, that you should not be watching. There are definitely some stretches towards the second half, but the directors accomplished a very respectable piece altogether. IFC Midnight rarely misses when it comes to the state of the art in contemporary horror; they’re just the best along with Shudder & A24.

I was getting increasingly pissed at everyone as time slowly passed by on this one, but then I remembered how teenage years were for me, and how <b>at 15 you know absolutely nothing, but you think you know everything</b>.

At 15 you’re a kid, yet you have the entire world weighting in at your shoulders, or at least that’s how it feels. You do so much reckless bullshit you can loose your innocence so quickly you don’t even see it coming. You put your body through so much stress, physically and mentally, it’s insane. So much energy, so many emotions, like a nuclear bomb waiting to go off.

It was heartbreaking to see how the girls and boys alike went all in, believing to their core that they would have the best time of their lives just because that’s the way it’s supposed to be, plus hormones are raging throughout your entire body at that age. They dived in so valiantly to the experience, thinking they would have the best time, thinking they were living through debauchery like little grown ups, that they could handle anything.

Turns out <b>at 15 you know nothing, yet you think you know everything. </b>It’s gut wrenching how you can literally see it in their faces, how they don’t even know how to react when stuff happens. They feel strongly yet they don’t know what to do.

But it’s OK not to know everything, you don’t have to be so strong. You don’t have the weight of the world in your shoulders. You’ll learn from your experiences, and ultimately you’ll be fine if you’re up for it.

Of course, some never make it, some still <b>know nothing, yet they think they know everything</b>.

2024-11-16,Threads,1984,https://boxd.it/7OE1IJ,3.5,,"Many people compare Threads to Elem Klimov's Come and See. Even though Threads plays a hypothetical scenario and Come and See practically happened, they have one strong common theme; they're both very effective anti-war films. In fact, these are the only two true anti-war films I've seen, apart from Mosul (2019), and Villeneuve's Incendies.

An anti-war film is one that is able to scare people out of the romantically heroic perception of war. They are effective in doing so by portraying suffering in an uncensored way; the human nature at its very lowest (when I say lowest I mean lowest). Both Threads & Come and See are extremely effective at their genre because they do this very well; they manage to portray what would really happen when things go haywire.

However, (and here comes the big but), Threads lacks the artistic qualities that made Come and See such a disheartening, impactful and haunting movie. Threads feels almost as a sober documentary, where the camera is just filming the heinous consequences of a nuclear apocalypse. Come and See is very different in that the atmosphere creeps inside you, slowly, steadily, until you realize you're completely involved with the characters, and you actually pitty the people that had to go through what Glasha & Florya went through.

I enjoyed Threads, but in my opinion, Come and See is still the de-facto anti-war film. The artistic talent of Klimov is simply superior, and that permeates the entire film in a way that is difficult to deny.

Some cheap scare jumps, and some (maybe) genuine ones (the makeup artist did a very good job), but it lacks the punch of true good horror films/shows.

The vibes are absolutely on point, highly reminiscent of Julio Torres’s & Taika Waititi‘s surreal works (Los Espookys & What We Do in the Shadows instantly come to mind), except here we have something much more elegant in its presentation, while spiking the right amount of quirkiness at just the right places.

It’s also very sophisticated, elegant, and careful on what it includes, what it doesn’t, how it communicates ideas, and what is not worth it. It never falls into vulgarity and boredom while still pursuing highly relevant contemporary sociological issues not only in countries with Muslim majorities but in the entire world.

She is reductionist and extremely lacking. She is extremely biased, and simply lacks the depth. I’m criticizing the director directly because this is the second in a row she’s done the exact same. She criticizes but she does not understand what she’s criticizing. It’s as if we need to adjust our views to her views, as if she’s doing us a favor in a sense?

This doesn’t work due to one main reason: I never cared. Not for Oliver, not for Felix, not for Elspeth, not for anyone. These characters don’t exist, they’re all extremely reductionist, they are not real, they are not as relatable as Saltburn might think.
