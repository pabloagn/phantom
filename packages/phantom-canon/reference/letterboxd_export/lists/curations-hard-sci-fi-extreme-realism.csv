2022-04-08,Curations: Hard Sci-Fi & Extreme Realism,curations,https://boxd.it/g7ehO,"This curation contains a mix of two types of films:

- Films that are under the Science Fiction genre, but that are specifically characterized for their concern of accuracy & logic. A prime example of this is <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/primer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Primer</a> by Shane Carruth.
-Â Films that are extremely realistic, with a mild to strong science fiction component, and do not necessarily rely on rigorous scientific theory, but the film mechanics are flawless & coherent. A prime example of this is <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/stalker/"" rel=""nofollow"">Stalker</a> by Andrei Tarkovsky."
