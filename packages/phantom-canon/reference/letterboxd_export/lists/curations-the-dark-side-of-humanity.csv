2022-04-08,Curations: The Dark Side of Humanity,curations,https://boxd.it/g7dUq,"This curation contains films dealing with the concept of evil and its many faces.

What is evil? Why do we have a wish for it? Why do we allow it? Is there a point in suffering?

The Dark Side of Humanity explores these questions by studying several award-winning films. All films have been proven to challenge how we think about the human kind.

Requirements:
- Award-winning films.
- Rely on hyper realism & have extremely scarce or null fantastical components.
- Have no rating restrictions.
- Have little to no positive nor uplifting components.

Films are ordered in ascending order based on how accurate (not necessarily how shocking or explicit) evil is portrayed (in my opinion)."
