2023-12-28,Movements: Dogme 95,movements,https://boxd.it/rcYSU,"Dogme 95 is a 1995 avant-garde filmmaking movement founded by the Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, who created the ""Dogme 95 Manifesto"" and the ""Vows of Chastity"" (Danish: kyskhedsløfter). These were rules to create films based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology.

The rules of Dogme 95 are:

<blockquote>1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).</blockquote><blockquote>2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot).</blockquote><blockquote>3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.</blockquote><blockquote>4. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).</blockquote><blockquote>5.  Optical work and filters are forbidden.
The film must not contain superficial action (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur).</blockquote><blockquote>6. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden (That is to say that the film takes place here and now).</blockquote><blockquote>7.  Genre movies are not acceptable.</blockquote><blockquote>8. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.</blockquote><blockquote>9. The director must not be credited.</blockquote>"
