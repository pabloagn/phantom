2023-12-29,Curations: Emotional Exploitation,curations,https://boxd.it/reL4Q,"This curation includes films that deeply engage emotionally, and sometimes distress mentally & physically. These are movies that have the power to drain people, to take advantage of people. These are movies where the director, as we say in Mexico, ""te va a tener agarrado de los huevos"" from start to end.

You may hate the director afterwards, you may hate humanity as a whole, but just maybe, you will get to know a part in yourself you didn't know you had.

Doesn't matter if the director emotionally abuses the characters, the public, or both, this collection includes only highly acclaimed films, avoiding pure shock value at all costs."
