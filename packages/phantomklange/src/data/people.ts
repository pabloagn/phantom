    excerpt: 'Russian novelist whose works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia.',
    content: `<p>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky was a Russian novelist, philosopher, short story writer, essayist, and journalist. His literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880).</p>
    <p>Dostoevsky's body of work consists of 12 novels, four novellas, 16 short stories, and numerous other works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as multiple of his works are considered to be among the greatest works of literature ever written. His 1864 novella Notes from Underground is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature.</p>
    <p>Born in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into Saint Petersburg's literary circles.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky was a Soviet filmmaker, writer, and film theorist. Widely considered one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in Soviet and world cinema, his films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, using a distinctive cinematic style characterized by long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and metaphorical symbolism.</p>
    <p>Tarkovsky directed seven feature films over his 20-year active career: Ivan's Childhood (1962), Andrei Rublev (1966), Solaris (1972), Mirror (1975), Stalker (1979), Nostalghia (1983), and The Sacrifice (1986). His films were characterized by metaphysical themes, extremely long takes, and memorable images of exceptional visual beauty. Prominent themes in his films include dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera.</p>
    <p>He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the Soviet Union; his last two films, Nostalghia and The Sacrifice, were produced in Italy and Sweden, respectively. Among his works are Andrei Rublev, Solaris, Mirror, and Stalker. He was a recipient of the Grand Prix du Jury at the Cannes Film Festival (for the film Solaris) and other honors.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century. He is best known for his contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. His groundbreaking work Being and Time (1927) established his reputation as an original thinker.</p>
    <p>Born in Me√ükirch, Germany, Heidegger studied theology before turning to philosophy. He was influenced by Edmund Husserl, who taught him phenomenology. Heidegger later became a professor at the University of Freiburg, where he taught for most of his career. His philosophy explores the question of Being (Sein) and what it means to be human (Dasein).</p>
    <p>Heidegger's work had a profound influence on many fields including philosophy, theology, literary theory, and psychology. His concepts of authenticity, thrownness, and the critique of technology continue to stimulate debate and research in various disciplines. Despite his significant philosophical contributions, his association with Nazism has remained a source of controversy and criticism.</p>`,

Widely considered one of the most accomplished and influential filmmakers of all time, Bergman's films are known for their explorations of mortality, illness, faith, betrayal, and insanity.</p>
    <p>Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays.

    <p>Bergman's films usually deal with existential questions of mortality, loneliness, and religious faith. While his earlier films are classified as "chamber dramas," his later work often examines the bleakness of modern life and features characters who are driven to extremes by intense emotional conflicts. Bergman's artistic vision, characterized by intense close-ups and sharp contrasts between light and darkness, has influenced countless filmmakers and artists across different mediums.</p>`,

    excerpt: 'German-language novelist and short-story writer whose surreal, nightmarish prose explores themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.',
    content: `<p>Franz Kafka was a German-language novelist and short-story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic. It typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers.</p>
    <p>Kafka was born into a middle-class German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the capital of the Czech Republic. He trained as a lawyer and after completing his legal education was employed full-time by an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married.</p>
    <p>His best known works include the short story "The Metamorphosis" and novels The Trial and The Castle. These works have influenced a range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers during the 20th and 21st centuries. In Kafka's fiction, characters struggle with incomprehensible predicaments and surreal scenarios, often involving transformation, isolation, and crushing bureaucracy.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Adeline Virginia Woolf was an English writer, considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Born in London to an affluent household, she was raised by free-thinking parents who encouraged her to read widely from her father's vast library.</p>
    <p>Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by mental illness. Though she received no formal education, she was tutored in the classics and literature. Together with her husband, Leonard Woolf, she founded the Hogarth Press in 1917, which published works by key modernist writers as well as Woolf's own novels. During the interwar period, she was a significant figure in London literary society and a central figure in the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.</p>
    <p>Woolf's works have been translated into more than 50 languages. She is best known for her novels To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Dalloway, and Orlando, and the feminist texts A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas. A pioneer of the modernist movement, she developed a narrative style that focused on psychological depth and employs a blend of memory, perception, and imagination. Her works often explore themes such as mental illness, gender roles, and the impact of social pressures on the individual.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Roland G√©rard Barthes was a French literary theorist, philosopher, critic, and semiotician. His work engaged in the analysis of a variety of sign systems, mainly derived from Western popular culture. His ideas explored a diverse range of fields and influenced the development of many schools of theory, including structuralism, semiotics, existentialism, Marxism, and post-structuralism.</p>
    <p>Born in Cherbourg, France, Barthes's early life was marked by personal challenges. His father died in a naval battle before his first birthday, and as a young man, he suffered from tuberculosis, which kept him away from academia for several years. Despite these setbacks, he emerged as one of the leading intellectual figures of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>Barthes is perhaps best known for his essay "The Death of the Author" (1967), in which he argued against traditional literary criticism's practice of incorporating the intentions and biographical context of an author in the interpretation of a text. Instead, he emphasized the importance of the reader's interpretation. His book Mythologies (1957) is another influential work, in which he deconstructs the meanings of popular cultural products, revealing the ideological content obscured by their apparent naturalness.</p>`,

    <p>Camus was born in Algeria to French parents. He grew up in poor conditions, but was a high achiever in school and was admitted to the University of Algiers. However, he contracted tuberculosis in 1930, which forced him to end his studies. This illness also prevented him from taking a teaching position or from joining the military service. Camus was an avid football player until the tuberculosis forced him to stop playing.</p>
    <p>Philosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He is also considered to be an existentialist, even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime. His philosophy can be understood through his concept of the absurd - the conflict between human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless, and irrational universe.</p>`,

He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents.</p>

In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including √âmile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes.

    content: `<p>Pablo Picasso was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.</p>
    <p>Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
    <p>Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901-1904), the Rose Period (1904-1906), the African-influenced Period (1907-1909), Analytic Cubism (1909-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919).</p>`,

    excerpt: 'A master of light and color who specialized in intimate domestic scenes of middle-class Dutch life in the 17th century.',
    content: `<p>Johannes Vermeer was a Dutch Baroque Period painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life. During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful provincial genre painter, recognized in Delft and The Hague. Nonetheless, he produced relatively few paintings and evidently was not wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death.</p>
    <p>Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive pigments. He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work. He painted mostly domestic interior scenes, and most of his paintings are set in the rooms of his house in Delft.</p>
    <p>Recognized during his lifetime in Delft and The Hague, his modest celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death. He was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists), and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries. In the 19th century, Vermeer was rediscovered by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Th√©ophile Thor√©-B√ºrger, who published an essay attributing 66 pictures to him, although only 34 paintings are universally attributed to him today.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and printmaker. An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history.</p>
    <p>Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. His self-portraits form a unique and intimate biography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.</p>
    <p>In his paintings and prints he exhibited knowledge of classical iconography, which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of Amsterdam's Jewish population. Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called "one of the great prophets of civilization".</p>`,

    excerpt: 'A founder of French Impressionism who captured changing light and atmosphere in nature through his distinctive brushwork and color palette.',
    content: `<p>Claude Monet was a French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.</p>
    <p>Born in Paris, France, Monet was raised in Normandy, where his father wanted him to follow his footsteps and go into the family's grocery business. However, Monet wanted to be an artist from a young age, and was encouraged by a local artist, Eug√®ne Boudin, who introduced him to plein air painting and to see the effects of light on color.</p>
    <p>Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899 he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.</p>`,

    <p>Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. Among Botticelli's best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera.</p>

    excerpt: 'A Norwegian Expressionist painter whose emotionally charged work explored psychological themes of fear, anxiety, and death.',
    content: `<p>Edvard Munch was a Norwegian painter, whose best known work, The Scream, has become one of the most iconic images of world art. His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (today's Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of nihilist Hans J√¶ger, who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state ('soul painting'). From this would develop his distinctive style.</p>
    <p>In the 1890s, Munch traveled to Paris, where he was influenced by the Post-Impressionists. In Berlin, he met Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom he painted. As his fame and wealth grew, his emotional state remained insecure. He briefly considered marriage, but could not commit himself. A breakdown in 1908 forced him to give up alcohol. After this, he received many commissions from various patrons, which improved his financial position substantially.</p>
    <p>Munch's works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. The 1994 version of The Scream was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and recovered. In 2004, versions of The Scream and Madonna were stolen from the Munch Museum, but recovered in 2006. Munch's The Scream is one of the highest-priced works of art ever sold at auction.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Diego Rodr√≠guez de Silva y Vel√°zquez was a Spanish painter, the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain and Portugal, and one of the most important painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He was an individualistic artist of the Baroque period. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece Las Meninas (1656).</p>
    <p>From the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Vel√°zquez's artwork was a model for the realist and impressionist painters, in particular √âdouard Manet. Since that time, famous modern artists, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal√≠ and Francis Bacon, have paid tribute to Vel√°zquez by recreating several of his most famous works.</p>
    <p>Vel√°zquez was born in Seville, Spain, the first child of Juan Rodriguez de Silva, a notary, and Jer√≥nima Vel√°zquez. His parents belonged to the hidalgo class, the lowest rank of the nobility, which exempted them from taxation. He was educated by his parents to fear God and to develop scholarly habits, but his main interest was in art, and he began his formal artistic training with Francisco Pacheco, a local painter.</p>`,

    excerpt: 'A German Romantic landscape painter whose contemplative and symbolic works elevated landscape painting to a spiritual experience.',
    content: `<p>Caspar David Friedrich was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world.</p>
    <p>Friedrich's paintings deliberately set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figure to a scale that directs the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension. He was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at that time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. His work was recognized for its contemplative aura and often morbid themes.</p>
    <p>Friedrich's work fell into obscurity after his death, but he became a significant figure in German art when the Expressionists and Surrealists rediscovered him in the early 20th century. His most famous works include Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (c. 1818), Abbey in the Oakwood (1810), and The Sea of Ice (1823‚Äì24).</p>`,
