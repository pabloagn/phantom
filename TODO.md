# TODOs

## Main TODOs

- [x] Implement missing core components, starting with the most frequently used ones: (NOTE: Please check under phantom core components, we already have a ton fo components defined and exported I think)
  - [x] Button, Input, Typography components
  - [x] Grid, Container and other layout components
  - [x] Navigation components (Menu, Navbar, Sidebar, Tabs)
  - [x] Modal, Drawer, Tooltip, Popover
  - [x] Card, Skeleton, Avatar, Badge
  - [x] Animation components (Fade, Slide, Scale, Transition)
- [ ] Set up a proper test framework with meaningful tests
- [ ] Configure Storybook for component development and visualization (Fill in the complete documentation for ``. You must avoid redundancy with README in phantom-core root.)
- [x] Update documentation with component examples and usage guidelines (yes, do this)
- [ ] Fix the linter errors in type definitions, especially around React types (leave this to the last)
