## System Architecture

Phantom is structured as a monorepo containing multiple interconnected packages, each responsible for specific functionality within the system.

### Core Components

- **Phantom Core**: Central hub, design system, and shared utilities
- **Phantom API**: Central API gateway for accessing Phantom services
- **PhantomKlange**: Digital catalogue and primary user interface

### Content Management

- **Phantom Canon**: Core content catalog and canon management
- **Phantom Intake**: Content ingestion pipeline
- **Phantom Editor**: Content editing and management interface

### Data & Storage

- **Phantom Glacier**: Digital asset storage
- **Phantom Vector**: Vector embedding and semantic search capabilities
- **Phantom Query**: Search and querying infrastructure

### User-Facing Components

- **Phantom RD**: eBook reader component
- **Phantom Explorer**: Interface for exploring the canon
- **Phantom Folio**: User collections and reading lists
- **Phantom EDA**: Exploratory data analysis tools

### Enrichment & Analysis

- **Phantom Enrichment**: Content enrichment and metadata generation

## System Interactions

The Phantom system is designed with a modular architecture where components communicate through well-defined interfaces. This architecture allows for:

1. **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different components in parallel
2. **Flexible Deployment**: Components can be deployed individually or as a whole
3. **Scalability**: Individual components can be scaled based on demand
4. **Resilience**: The system can continue to function even if some components are unavailable

## Technology Stack

Phantom uses a modern JavaScript/TypeScript stack with:

- **pnpm**: For package management
- **Turborepo**: For build orchestration
- **React**: For user interfaces
- **Next.js**: For web applications
- **Node.js**: For backend services
